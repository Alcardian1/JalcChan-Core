# JalcChan-Core
JalcChan-Core is the backend code for an 4chan viewing app.

This project started out from the thought that I wanted some easy way to find topics that are of interest for me (e.g. Warcraft related topics when I played WoW) and remove topics that I know I have no interest in viewing (e.g. Witcher related topics as I don't want the entire story spoiled before I play it).


This project is reliant on Jsoup and Alc_IO
